Level up as an advanced Go developer in this course with instructor Michael Okuboyejo. Michael guides you through the essentials of event-driven architecture, focusing on key patterns such as event sourcing and command and query responsibility segregation (CQRS). Learn about the fundamentals of producing and consuming events efficiently using popular Go libraries and Kafka as a message broker. Along the way, Michael outlines practical strategies for ensuring system resilience and consistency, error handling in an event-driven context, and deploying applications effectively. By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the skills required to build robust event-driven applications in Go and ensure they’re ready for scalable production environments.

Learning objectives
- Analyze the principles of event-driven architecture, including event sourcing and command and query responsibility segregation (CQRS) patterns, to design scalable and resilient systems.
- Construct event-driven applications in Go, utilizing the official Kafka Go Client and Kafka as a message broker, to efficiently produce and consume events.
- Evaluate strategies for ensuring system resilience, consistency, error handling, and deployment of event-driven applications in production environments.
